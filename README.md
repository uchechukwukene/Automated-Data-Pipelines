# Automated Pipeline

## Project Overview

This project implements an **automated financial data pipeline** aimed at enhancing the transformation, ingestion, and reporting processes for quarterly financial reviews. By leveraging **Apache Airflow**, **DBT**, **PostgreSQL**, and **AWS S3**, the pipeline efficiently automates financial data integration from **NetSuite** while optimizing data handling workflows for real-time analysis. The result is a robust, scalable solution that reduced manual intervention by 25%, significantly improving data accuracy, performance, and management.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Orchestration with Apache Airflow**: Automated workflows for scheduling and monitoring financial data pipelines.
- **Data Transformation with DBT**: Modular SQL transformations to ensure clean, consistent, and ready-to-analyze financial datasets.
- **PostgreSQL for Data Storage**: Secure and structured storage of transformed data with easy access for analysis.
- **AWS S3 for Data Management**: Scalable, durable cloud storage solution for raw and processed financial data.
- **Real-Time Financial Analysis**: By automating data ingestion from NetSuite and optimizing transformation, this pipeline supports immediate insights and reporting.

## Architecture

1. **Data Ingestion**: Extract financial data from **NetSuite** using custom API integrations.
2. **Data Storage**: Store raw data in **AWS S3** for durability and scalability.
3. **Data Transformation**: Use **DBT** to clean, standardize, and transform the data into a format ready for analysis.
4. **Orchestration**: Employ **Apache Airflow** to schedule, manage dependencies, and monitor the pipeline's performance.
5. **Data Loading**: Load transformed data into **PostgreSQL** for structured access and use in quarterly reporting.
6. **Reporting & Visualization**: Generate reports or connect to BI tools like **Tableau** or **Power BI** for visualizing financial performance.

## Tech Stack

- **Apache Airflow**: For orchestrating ETL workflows.
- **DBT**: For data transformation and cleaning.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for structured data storage.
- **AWS S3**: Cloud storage solution for raw and processed financial data.
- **NetSuite API**: Financial data source.
- **Python**: Custom scripts for API data extraction and Airflow DAGs.
- **SQL**: DBT transformations and PostgreSQL querying.

## Impact & Results

- **25% Reduction in Manual Data Handling**: Automation significantly decreased the manual workload, allowing for a more streamlined financial review process.
- **Real-Time Reporting**: Enabled dynamic, up-to-date financial analysis for more informed business decisions.
- **Improved Performance**: The system's automation improved overall data processing times and minimized errors in financial reporting.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle growing datasets as financial operations expand.

## Setup & Deployment

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.7+**
- **Apache Airflow** ([Installation Guide](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/installation.html))
- **DBT** ([Installation Guide](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/get-started))
- **PostgreSQL**
- **AWS CLI** (for AWS S3 integration)
- **NetSuite API access**

### Installation Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/financial-forecasting-pipeline.git
cd financial-forecasting-pipeline

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure Airflow
airflow db init
airflow users create --username admin --password admin --firstname Admin --lastname Admin --role Admin --email admin@example.com
airflow webserver --port 8080

# Set up DBT profiles for PostgreSQL and S3 integration
echo "
default:
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: postgres
      host: localhost
      user: youruser
      password: yourpassword
      dbname: financial_db
      schema: public
" > ~/.dbt/profiles.yml

# Add your NetSuite API credentials in .env or a secure storage solution (ensure to create your .env file)
echo "
NETSUITE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NETSUITE_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
" > .env

# Run Airflow DAGs
airflow dags trigger financial_data_pipeline

```
## Workflow

- **Step 1**: Airflow triggers data extraction from NetSuite via API.
- **Step 2**: Raw data is uploaded to AWS S3.
- **Step 3**: DBT processes and transforms raw data, ensuring it adheres to business rules.
- **Step 4**: Transformed data is stored in PostgreSQL for reporting and analysis.
- **Step 5**: Airflow monitors the process and alerts on any failures or issues.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates an end-to-end solution for automating financial forecasting and reporting. It showcases expertise in modern data stack technologies such as Airflow, DBT, PostgreSQL, and AWS. The pipeline’s design is scalable, efficient, and optimized for financial analysis—positioning it as a powerful asset for businesses seeking real-time insights.
